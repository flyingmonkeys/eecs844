In general, the GSC works as well or better than the MVDR filter. By using a degree of
freedom to concentrate a null at a chosen location, the null is much deeper than that
created by the MVDR filter.

Since there are only 3 (known) signals, and 10 array elements, the GSC has enough
degrees of freedom to effectively create the null while still meeting the unity gain
constraint and the single null constraint.
