The raw response shows the composite signal of all signals coming from all directions.

The non-adaptive filter, which simply peaks at the boresight angle, will filter out signals
from outside the main lobe, but as seen in problem 3, there are signals of interest close to
the boresight and presumably within the main lobe or first sidelobe, so the signal magnitude,
which smaller than the raw signal, is still fairly high.

The MVDR filter, developed in problem 3d, is designed to admit signals at the boresight with
unity gain, and reject (null) stronger signals outside the boresight. As expected, the time
domain magnitude response is much lower, and is very close to unity.
